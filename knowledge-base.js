// ==========================================

// 1. To connect to a database instead of using hardcoded knowledge:
/*
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI);

async function findInKnowledgeBase(query) {
  await client.connect();
  const db = client.db('learning-assistant');

    $text: { $search: query } 
  }, {
    score: { $meta: "textScore" }
  }).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } });
  
  return result ? result.answer : null;
}
*/

// 2. Adding feedback mechanisms to improve the bot
/*
app.action('thumbs_up', async ({ body, ack }) => {
  await ack();
  // Log positive feedback
  console.log(`User ${body.user.id} found answer helpful`);
  // Thank the user
  await app.client.chat.postEphemeral({
    channel: body.channel.id,
    user: body.user.id,
    text: "Thanks for the feedback! I'm glad that was helpful."
  });
});

app.action('thumbs_down', async ({ body, ack, say }) => {
  await ack();
  // Log negative feedback
  console.log(`User ${body.user.id} found answer unhelpful`);
  // Offer additional help
  await app.client.chat.postEphemeral({
    channel: body.channel.id,
    user: body.user.id,
    text: "I'm sorry that wasn't helpful. Would you like me to connect you with a human instructor?"
  });
});
*/

// 3. Scheduling reminders for upcoming deadlines
/*
const schedule = require('node-schedule');

// Send a reminder every Monday at 9am
schedule.scheduleJob('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  // Get all channels the bot is in
  const channelList = await app.client.conversations.list();
  
  // Get upcoming assignments (from your database or API)
  const upcomingAssignments = getUpcomingAssignments();
  
  if (upcomingAssignments.length > 0) {
    const reminderText = `ðŸ“… *Weekly Reminder*\nUpcoming deadlines:\n${
      upcomingAssignments.map(a => `â€¢ ${a.name}: due ${a.dueDate}`).join('\n')
    }`;
    
    // Send to all channels
    for (const channel of channelList.channels) {

          text: reminderText
        });
      }
